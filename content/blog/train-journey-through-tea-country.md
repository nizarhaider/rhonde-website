Often described as one of the most beautiful train journeys in the world, the rail route from Kandy to Ella takes travelers through Sri Lanka's stunning hill country, offering breathtaking views of lush tea plantations, misty mountains, and picturesque villages.

Our adventure began at the colonial-era Kandy railway station, where we boarded the blue train bound for Ella. While first-class observation cars with air conditioning are available, we opted for second-class seats to enjoy the fresh mountain air through open windows and doors – perfect for photography and truly immersing ourselves in the experience.

The journey covers approximately 140 kilometers and takes around 7 hours, though delays are common. Rather than seeing this as an inconvenience, we embraced the leisurely pace as part of the charm. The slow train allows passengers to fully appreciate the changing landscapes and capture stunning photographs along the way.

As we climbed higher into the hills, the scenery transformed dramatically. The urban surroundings of Kandy gave way to verdant valleys and eventually the emerald-green tea plantations that Sri Lanka is famous for. Tamil tea pickers in colorful saris could be spotted working among the precisely manicured tea bushes that carpet the hillsides.

One of the journey's highlights came about three hours in when we reached Nanu Oya station, the access point for the colonial hill station of Nuwara Eliya. The temperature dropped noticeably as we reached this elevation, and the mist rolling across the tea plantations created an almost mystical atmosphere.

The section between Nanu Oya and Ella is widely considered the most spectacular part of the journey. The train winds around steep cliffs, through numerous tunnels carved through the mountains, and across viaducts offering vertigo-inducing views of the valleys below. The famous Nine Arch Bridge near Ella is an engineering marvel and one of the most photographed spots in Sri Lanka.

Throughout the journey, local vendors move through the carriages selling an array of snacks, from fresh mango sprinkled with chili salt to crispy vadai (savory fritters). These make for a delicious and authentic culinary experience as you take in the scenery.

For the best views, try to secure seats on the right side of the train when traveling from Kandy to Ella. However, passengers frequently hang from the open doorways (carefully and at their own risk) to take in views from both sides – an exhilarating experience that has become somewhat iconic of this journey.
